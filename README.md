Hi, I'm Henry and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. I have a passion for writing Low-Level Software and Real-time 3D Rendering. I'm always open to new and excited challenges, no matter what! Which is probably shown by the vastly different topics I take up. 

I really enjoy working in languages that challenge me such as C/C++. 

Here's some things I've worked on: 

### Hobby Rendering Engine

![Hobby Rendering Engine](https://github.com/Progalt/HobbyEngine/) - I wrote this to learn about modern rendering approaches including TAA, Compute and more. 

### DMG Gameboy Emulator

![Gameboy Emulator](https://github.com/Progalt/gbex/) - A Gameboy Emulator written in C++17, used as a tool to learn more about older hardware and how to emulate them. Featuring a functional CPU, and mostly functional PPU. It can play the majority of Games running MBC1 and 5 Mapper Chips. 

### Interpreted Programming Language
```
class CoffeeMaker

	static var coffeesMade = 0

	function brew(type)
		
		println("Brewing your coffee...")

		self.coffeesMade = self.coffeesMade + 1

		println("Made your coffee: " + type)
	end
end

var coffeeMaker = CoffeeMaker()

coffeeMaker.brew("Latte")
coffeeMaker.brew("Americano")

println(CoffeeMaker.coffeesMade)
```
![Solis](https://github.com/Progalt/Solis/) - A Small interpreted Language written in C with a Lua and Ruby like syntax. Runs similar in performance to Python3.
